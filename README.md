# Malware-Analysis-Triage
Dissecting and diving into the world of Malware Analysis!

The essential lesson of Malware Analysis is the paramount importance of safety. As I embarked on this course, my initial excitement was tinged with a touch of nervousness. Malware was always something to be avoided but the opportunity to see the inner workings of malware, delving deep into its functionality, and unraveling the mysteries of its behavior is an invaluable learning experience!>

## Introduction:
This blog is about my personal experience learning Malware Analysis and Triage. I am taking a course called "Practical Malware Analysis and Triage" from TCM Security. Out of respect for the course content, I won't detail my entire in depth experience as I feel it's incredibly worth exploring on your own. 

## The Importance of Safety:
- Preventing malware infections on host machines through a healthy paranoid
- Isolated the guest VMs by attaching them to a Host-only Adapter.
- Adjusted IP addresses to avoid conflicts with host IP.
- Ensured that guest VMs could communicate with each other but not with the host.
- Paranoid compulsion to check on adapter settings and pinging before and following malware detonations.

## The Setup 
- Created two new VMs: Remnux (Ubuntu) and Flare VM (Windows).
### Flare VM 
  - Flare VM is packed with essential tools for Malware Analysis.
  - Sometimes all the tool packages don't install correctly but they are easy to find online. I had issues with PEView.
  - Notice the internet is showing as not connected - it should never be when detonating malware. Be safe! :)

### Remnux VM
- Remnux's role in creating a fake internet environment using the terminal command "inetsim".
 - Important to trick malware into thinking it's connected to the internet. Some malware are designed to exit the program and then delete themselves from the disk if they don't detect a domain.
